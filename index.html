<h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</h1>
<h1>Naomi Peter Kuguru </h1>
<p>I have often heard a lot of people in Tanzania say that females always have the same boring 
life cycle...and i being as stubborn as i am i have never accepted that ridiculous ideology to
be part of my future goal.</p> 
<p>Being part of the priveleged few percent of females in my country to reach a stage of higher 
learning after working hard from primary,secondary,high school to university gives the courage
to believe the saying <em>"if there is a will there is a way". </em></p>

<p>Despite every struggle i strictly  continue engaging my self with enterprenueship
and i look up to very big enterprenuers such as Mohamed Dewji and hope to become like like or
more</p>
