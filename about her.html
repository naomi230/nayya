<h1>Background Information</h1>
<p>I studied in Mwanza for my primary education at Montessory Primary School,
for secondary i went to Kom secondary school Nganza High School and am currently
pursuing Bsc in computer science</p>

<p>In terms of likes and dislikes am a very open person in terms of food ,its one of 
things that i honestly enjoy to the fullest.In terms of entertainment am not a big fun of
movies since i believe they are a far perception from reality and make peolple forget who theys
really are.
Social media is essential but i hate it to the fullest because of the addiction it causes to human 
being and a drive from reality that it bestows to people.
However i realy like reading books that have a strict contibution to personal development be
it physical,mental or spiritual.
